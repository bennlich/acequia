Acequia TODO
------------

Slightly in order of priority.

Make notes for function headers in acequia.js (make sure username strings vs. client ids are clear).
Allow sending to a list of clients, or possibly a broadcast to all clients.
Add 'webSocket address' parameter to clients so two websocket clients can communicate directly rather than going through acequia.  Empty string for not supported or a uri if a server is listening.
Automatic obtaining of server IP.  (Sort of already implemented, just AJAX plasticSarcastic/nodejs/scrJoinServer.php).
Resurrect HTTP server.
Finish up Java OSC client.
Resurrect TCP server.
