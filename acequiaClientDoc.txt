Acequia WebSocket Client Documentation
--------------------------------------

This client is a communication layer for communicating with the acequia server
via websockets.  Most complicated networking code is abstracted from the user
and replaced with simple send/receive functions.

Function List:
--------------

acConnect(uri,callback);
	uri:		string containing location of websocket server.  example: "ws://1.2.3.4:1234"
	callback:	function to execute when connection is opened.

Connects to the websocket server specified by 'uri' and executes 'callback' when complete.


acSend(to,title,body);
	to:		string containing username of intended recipient.  examples: "userid", ""
	title:		string containing title of message to be sent.  example: "/connect"
	body:		array containing message data.  example: ["string",142.76,"another string"]

Sends a message named 'title' containing the data 'body' to the intended
recipient 'to'.  'to' is to be left blank when sending a system message.


acReceive(callback);
	callback:	function to execute when a message is received.

Defines a function 'callback' to be executed when data is received.  'callback'
should take three arguments:
	from:		string containing username of sender ('SYS' when receiving from acequia server).
	title:		string containing the title of the received message.
	body:		array containing message data.


System Messages:
----------------

Currently there are two system messages reserved for use by acequia.
By convention these start with a slash "/".

/connect
    Used when connecting to and registering with an acequia server.
    Expects the body to contain a string specifying the username to log in as.
    
    Returns:
        1: successful login.
        -1: username is already taken.
      
      
/getClients
    Used to obtain usernames of all connected clients.
    Takes no parameters in the body.
    
    Returns:
        An array of the usernames of all connected clients.
